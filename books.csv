The Catcher in the Rye	J.D. Salinger	Since his debut in 1951 as The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield has been synonymous with "cynical adolescent." Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,<>"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them."<>His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.	0316769177	9780316769174	Academic > School,Young Adult,Young Adult > Coming Of Age,Young Adult > High School,Literature > American,Academic > Read For School,Classics > Classic Literature,Book Club	The_Catcher_in_the_Rye.jpg

Steps to Christ	Ellen G. White	Book may have numerous typos, missing text, images, or index. Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1908. Excerpt: ... Rejoicing in the Lord The children of God are called to be representatives of Christ, showing forth the goodness and mercy of the Lord. As Jesus has revealed to us the true character of the Father, so we are to reveal Christ to a world that does not know his tender, pitying love. "As thou hast sent me into the world," said Jesus, "even so have I also sent them into the world." "I in them, and thou in me, . . . that the world may know that thou hast sent me."1 The apostle Paul says to the disciples of Jesus, " Ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ," "known and read of all men."2 In every one of his children, Jesus sends a letter to the world. If you are Christ's follower, he sends in you a letter to the family, the village, the street, where you live. Jesus, dwelling in you, desires to speak to the hearts of those who are not acquainted with him. Perhaps they do not read the Bible, or do not hear the voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see the love of God through his works. But if you are a true representative of Jesus, it may be that through you they will be led to understand something of his goodness, and be won to love and serve him. Christians are set as light bearers on the way to heaven. They are to reflect to the world the light shining upon them from Christ . Their life and character should be such that through them others will get a right conception of Christ and of his service. 1 John 17: 18. 23. :1 Cor. R: 8. 2. If we do represent Christ, we shall make his service appear attractive, as it really is. Christians who gather up gloom and sadness to their souls,, and murmur and complain, are giving to others a false representation of God and the Christian life. They give the impression that God is not pleased to have his children happy, and in t...	0816317992	9780816317998	Religion,Christian,Spirituality,Religion > Theology	Steps_to_Christ.jpg

Wolf Totem	Jiang Rong	An epic Chinese tale in the vein of <>The Last Emperor<>, Wolf Totem depicts the dying culture of the Mongols-the ancestors of the Mongol hordes who at one time terrorized the world-and the parallel extinction of the animal they believe to be sacred: the fierce and otherworldly Mongolian wolf<> Published under a pen name, <>Wolf Totem<> was a phenomenon in China, breaking all sales records there and earning the distinction of being the second most read book after Mao's little red book.

Their philosophy of maintaining a balance with nature is the ground stone of their religion, a kind of cult of the wolf. <> The fierce wolves that haunt the steppes of the unforgiving grassland searching for food are locked with the nomads in a profoundly spiritual battle for survival-a life-and-death dance that has gone on between them for thousands of years. The Mongols believe that the wolf is a great and worthy foe that they are divinely instructed to contend with, but also to worship and to learn from. Chen's own encounters with the otherworldly wolves awake a latent primitive instinct in him, and his fascination with them blossoms into obsession, then reverence. <> After many years, the peace is shattered with the arrival of Chen's kinfolk, Han Chinese, sent from the cities to bring modernity to the grasslands. They immediately launch a campaign to exterminate the wolves, sending the balance that has been maintained with religious dedication for thousands of years into a spiral leading to extinction-first the wolves, then the Mongol culture, finally the land. As a result of the eradication of the wolves, rats become a plague and wild sheep graze until the meadows turn to dust. Mongolian dust storms glide over Beijing, sometimes blocking out the moon. <> Part period epic, part fable for modern days, <>Wolf Totem<> is a stinging social commentary on the dangers of China's overaccelerated economic growth as well as a fascinating immersion into the heart of Chinese culture.	1594201560	9781594201561	Cultural > China,Fiction,Historical Fiction,Literature,Animals,Novels,Cultural > Asia,Literature > Asian Literature,Asian Literature > Chinese Literature	Wolf_Totem.jpg

The Grapes of Wrath	John Steinbeck	John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression follows the western movement of one family & a nation in search of work & human dignity. Perhaps the most American of American classics. The novel focuses on the Joads, a poor family of sharecroppers driven from their Oklahoma home by drought, economic hardship, & changes in financial & agricultural industries. Due to their nearly hopeless situation, & in part because they were trapped in the Dust Bowl, the Joads set out for California. Along with thousands of other "Okies", they sought jobs, land, dignity & a future. When preparing to write the novel, Steinbeck wrote: "I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this [the Great Depression & its effects]." The book won Steinbeck a large following among the working class, perhaps due to the book's sympathy to the workers' movement & its accessible prose style.<>The Grapes of Wrath<> is frequently read in American high school & college literature classes. A celebrated Hollywood film version, starring Henry Fonda & directed by John Ford, was made in 1940.	0142000663	9780142000663	Literature,Academic > School,Young Adult > High School,Classics > Classic Literature,Academic > Read For School,History,Literature > American,Adult,Book Club	The_Grapes_of_Wrath.jpg

Man's Search for Meaning	Viktor E. Frankl	With a new Foreword by Harold S. Kushner<>and a new Biographical Afterword by William J. Winslade<>Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory-known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos ("meaning")-holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.<>At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, <>Man's Search for Meaning<> had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages.

Things Fall Apart (The African Trilogy, #1)	Chinua Achebe	THINGS FALL APART tells two overlapping, intertwining stories, both of which center around Okonkwo, a “strong man” of an Ibo village in Nigeria. The first of these stories traces Okonkwo's fall from grace with the tribal world in which he lives, and in its classical purity of line and economical beauty it provides us with a powerful fable about the immemorial conflict between the individual and society. <>The second story, which is as modern as the first is ancient, and which elevates the book to a tragic plane, concerns the clash of cultures and the destruction of Okonkwo's world through the arrival of aggressive, proselytizing European missionaries. These twin dramas are perfectly harmonized, and they are modulated by an awareness capable of encompassing at once the life of nature, human history, and the mysterious compulsions of the soul. THINGS FALL APART is the most illuminating and permanent monument we have to the modern African experience as seen from within.	0385474547	9780385474542	Classics,Cultural > Africa,Historical Fiction,Literature,Academic > Read For School,Novels,Literature > African Literature,Young Adult > High School,Fiction	Things_Fall_Apart_(The_African_Trilogy,_#1).jpg
